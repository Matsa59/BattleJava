# BattleJava
This is the first exerice in java
You can download source code.

Caution : models have been synchronized and packages have been observed as the teacher said.

Because this exercice is really bad, you can have an inifite loop...
So when you run it does not wait more than 5 secondes (kill thread otherwise).
